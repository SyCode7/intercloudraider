#summary how to install Intercloud RAIDer.

== Pre-Installation ==

The users have to register for an account at the cloud service providers and get a pair of client id and client secret after registration that is supporting by InterCloud RAIDer. The procedures of registration at different cloud service providers are describing as follows:

=== Dropbox ===

Please log on to the Dropbox website https://www.dropbox.com/register and provide an valid email to create an account at Dropbox.



=== Google Drive ===

Please log on to the https://cloud.google.com/console#/flows/enableapi?apiid=drive and follows the instructions provided to create a project.

If you haven't already registered your application with the Google Cloud Console, then set up a project and application in the Cloud Console. The system guides you through the process of choosing or creating a project and registering a new application, and it automatically activates the API for you.

If you've already registered your application with the Cloud Console, then follow this procedure instead:

Go to the Google Cloud Console.
Select a project.
In the sidebar on the left, select APIs & auth. In the displayed list of APIs, make sure the Drive API status is set to ON.
In the sidebar on the left, select Registered apps.
Select an application.
In either case, you end up on the application's credentials page.

To find your application's client ID and client secret, and set a redirect URI, expand the OAuth 2.0 Client ID section.

Take note of the Client ID as you'll need to add it to your code later.\
