== Prerequisites ==


=== Qt ===

The implementation of !InterCloud RAIDer is developed under the [http://qt.digia.com/ Qt/C++] framework. If you want to make any modification or improve the original code, please download [http://qt-project.org/downloads Qt4.8 or any later version].
 
=== PolarSSL ===

The Provable Data Possession (PDP) mechanism of !InterCloud RAIDer is using PolarSSL in its algorithms. Since each cipher and hashing algorithm in PolarSSL (AES, MD5, SHA-1, etc.) is self-contained and can be easily reused as a standalone module, we used only a modified version of PolarSSL which only including the implementation of [https://polarssl.org/aes-source-code AES] and a version of random number generator ([https://polarssl.org/ctr-drbg-source-code CTR-DRBG]).
