#summary how to install Intercloud RAIDer.

== Pre-Installation ==

The users have to register for an account at the cloud service providers that are supporting by !InterCloud RAIDer and get a pair of client id and client secret after registration. During the first running of !InterCloud RAIDer, the system will request for the pair of client id and client secret that is retrieving from the service providers. Then the system will use the pair for authorization when making access requests to the service providers. See [] for more details.

The procedures of registration at different cloud service providers are describing as follows:

=== Dropbox ===

If you don't have a Dropbox account, please log on to  https://www.dropbox.com/register and register for an account by providing an valid email.

Please visit https://www.dropbox.com/developers/apps/create and create an application.

Then, the webpage will be redirect to another page. app key is your client id, and app secret is your client secret.



=== Google Drive ===

If you don't have a Google account, please log on to  https://accounts.google.com/SignUp and register for an account.

 * If you haven't already registered your application with the Google Cloud Console, then please visit  https://cloud.google.com/console#/flows/enableapi?apiid=drive and set up a project and application in the Cloud Console. 
 * The system guides you through the process of choosing or creating a project and registering a new application, and it automatically activates the API for you.

 * If you've already registered your application with the Cloud Console, then follow this procedure instead:

 # Go to the Google Cloud Console.
 # Select a project.
 # In the sidebar on the left, select APIs & auth. In the displayed list of APIs, make sure the Drive API status is set to ON.
 # In the sidebar on the left, select Registered apps.
 # Select an application.

In either case, you end up on the application's credentials page.

To find your application's client ID and client secret, and set a redirect URI, expand the OAuth 2.0 Client ID section.

Take note of the Client ID as you'll need to add it to your code later.\
