#summary how to use InterCloud RAIDer.

== First Running of !InterCloud RAIDer ==
After installation of the !InterCloud RAIDer, the users will be requested for a pair of [Registration key and secret] during the first running which is needed for authorization when making access requests to cloud services according to [http://oauth.net/core/1.0/ OAuth1.0]/[http://oauth.net/ OAuth2.0]. The pair of credentials will then be stored in the local database of !InterCloud RAIDer. During the authorization process, the system will retrieve the pair from the local database. 

The users can generate the key and secret pair by following the instructions in the [Registration].

=== Modify Key and Secret === 
The users may check and modify the key and secret even after first input:
 # Click *Settings* in the side bar on the top left.
 # Click *Background Parameter* and proceed to Background Parameter Page.

*Retrieve*, *Delete*, and *Verify*.

=== Verify ===
The users may verify the integrity of outsourced data at every service provider, so that the data is not compromised by misbehaving of individual services, e.g. illegitimate modification or deletion, by using Provable Data Possession (PDP) mechanism. We omit the details of PDP and the users who are interested in PDP can refer to [Wiki page].

To begin, please follow the following steps:

== Access Token ==
For every running of !InterCloud RAIDer, the users are being asked for the consent to process the authorization protocol ([http://oauth.net/core/1.0/ OAuth1.0]/[http://oauth.net/ OAuth2.0]) when making access requests to cloud services during the execution of the functions, e.g., backup, retrieve, delete, and verify. 

The users are either be requested to approve the authorization process by clicking "*allow*", "*accept*" or "*Add this computer*" by visiting the webpages of the cloud services, or be requested to provide an one-time *verification code* after being redirected to another webpage.
